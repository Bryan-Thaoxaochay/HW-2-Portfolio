# HW-2-Portfolio

# Purpose

The purpose of this assignment was to create a functional webpage with the help of bootstrap. The webpage had to connect with other webpages, have a navbar, and have a responsive layout and images.

# What I Learned

## Navbar

I learned how to change the wording on the navbar, creating links to other webpages on the same website, changing the color, font size, font color, font type, and creating a button that contain the links in case the screen resolution shrinks to a certain point.

## Container, Rows, and Columns

I got the opportunity to practice with rows and columns. I was able to organize and adjust the layout to my choosing. 

## Contact Form

With a lot of help from bootstrap, I was able to create a form with headers, text boxes, and a submit button. Although it doesn't work yet, it does look neat. 

## Semantics

I researched a bit more on semantics and was able to apply it to my code. However, I still do not understand every semantic tag yet. Seeing examples of how it can be used really showed the impact it has on reading code. I wasn't lost on just reading div, div, and div over and over.

Although I learned all of this, I still have a lot of room to improve.

# Description

## Navbar

The navbar on each webpage is the same. It has four links corresponding to its specific title. It also has my name shown, which is a link to the About Me webpage. Lastly, the three links beside my name turn into a buttom when the webpage shrinks.

## About Me

The About Me page is a simple layout of a navbar, header, image, paragraphs, and footer. Everything beside the navbar is wrapped inside a container. The paragraphs are short descriptions of my background and an introduction to my beginner portfolio website. 

## Contact

The Contact page contains a navbar, header, form, and links. The contact form has three textboxes where one can enter their name, their email, and a message. Once they have filled those out, there is a submit button at the bottom. Unfortunately, it does not work yet. Other than that, there are links to the right that go to my LinkedIn and GitHub pages. 

## Portfolio

The Portfolio page is the simplest one. All it has are five placeholder images within a container.
